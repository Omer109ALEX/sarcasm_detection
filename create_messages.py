Detecting Sarcasm in Text: Key Checkpoints and Examples

1. Contradiction Between Literal Meaning and Context:
   Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant. Look for statements where the literal meaning contradicts the implied meaning.
   - Example: "Oh great, another meeting. Just what I needed."
     Here, "great" is used sarcastically because meetings are typically not something people look forward to.

2. Exaggeration:
   Sarcasm can involve hyperbolic statements that exaggerate to an absurd degree.
   - Example: "I had the best day ever, I lost my job!"
     The exaggeration of "best day ever" contrasts with the negative event of losing a job, indicating sarcasm.

3. Unexpected Context:
   Statements that seem out of place or overly dramatic for the situation can be sarcastic.
   - Example: "Yeah, because I'm just *so* good at cooking," after burning dinner.
     The unexpected praise for poor performance hints at sarcasm.

4. Punctuation and Emphasis:
   Sarcasm can be indicated by specific punctuation marks, such as quotation marks, italics, or ellipses.
   - Example: "Yeah, because that was a *brilliant* idea..."
     The use of italics and ellipses suggests a sarcastic tone.

5. Contextual Incongruity:
   A statement that is incongruous or mismatched with the situation can be sarcastic.
   - Example: "What a beautiful day," said on a rainy day.
     The statement doesn't match the context of the weather, indicating sarcasm.

6. Understatement:
   Sarcasm can also be conveyed through understatement, where the speaker downplays something significant.
   - Example: "Not bad," after winning a gold medal.
     The understatement of "not bad" contrasts with the significant achievement, implying sarcasm.

7. Positive Adjectives in Negative Situations:
   Using overly positive adjectives to describe a negative situation often indicates sarcasm.
   - Example: "Fantastic, now my computer crashed."
     The word "fantastic" is positive, but the situation is negative, suggesting sarcasm.

8. ClichÃ© Phrases:
   Certain clichÃ© phrases are commonly used sarcastically.
   - Example: "Oh, joy," when faced with an unpleasant task.
     This phrase is often used sarcastically to express the opposite of joy.

9. Tone of Certainty:
   Sarcasm can be conveyed through a tone of certainty or assurance about something that is clearly not true.
   - Example: "Sure, I believe you."
     The certainty in the statement, when paired with an unbelievable claim, indicates sarcasm.

10. Redundancy of Obvious Facts:
    Stating the obvious in an exaggerated manner can be a marker of sarcasm.
    - Example: "Of course the printer jammed. It always jams right when I'm in a hurry."
      The redundancy emphasizes the annoyance and indicates sarcasm.

11. Playful Insults:
    Sarcastic comments can often take the form of playful insults or teasing remarks.
    - Example: "Nice job on that presentation, really top-notch," when the presentation was poorly done.
      The compliment is given in a context where it is clearly not deserved, indicating sarcasm.

12. Literal Statements with Implicit Contradictions:
    Sometimes, a statement is literally true but delivered in a way that implies the opposite meaning.
    - Example: "Well, that was productive," after a meeting where nothing was accomplished.
      The literal truth (the meeting was held) contrasts with the implied meaning (the meeting was unproductive).

13. Hashtags and Emojis:
    Sarcasm on social media often includes specific hashtags or emojis that indicate a sarcastic tone.
    - Example: "Just got a flat tire. #blessed ðŸ™ƒ"
      The hashtag "#blessed" and the upside-down face emoji suggest sarcasm about an unfortunate event.

14. Quotation Marks for Irony:
    Quotation marks can be used to indicate irony or sarcasm.
    - Example: "Had a 'great' time waiting in line for two hours."
      The quotation marks around "great" indicate that the word is being used ironically.

15. Mock Enthusiasm:
    Overly enthusiastic language about mundane or negative events can be a sign of sarcasm.
    - Example: "Yay! Another meeting at 7 AM!"
      The "Yay!" and exclamation mark indicate sarcasm about an early meeting.

16. Short, Snappy Replies:
    Brief responses that use concise language can be sarcastic, especially in the context of a conversation.
    - Example: "Sure, because that makes total sense."
      The brevity and the phrase "total sense" imply sarcasm.

17. Capitalization for Emphasis:
    Unusual capitalization patterns, like all caps, can indicate sarcasm.
    - Example: "I REALLY needed that."
      The use of all caps for "REALLY" emphasizes sarcasm.

18. Tagging and Mentioning:
    Tagging or mentioning others in a way that suggests exaggeration or irony can be a marker of sarcasm.
    - Example: "Thanks @airline for the 'amazing' service."
      Tagging the airline and using quotation marks around "amazing" indicate sarcasm about poor service.

19. Ellipses for Suspense:
    Ellipses can be used to create a sarcastic tone by adding a pause that suggests something contrary to what is stated.
    - Example: "Just what I wanted... another email."
      The ellipsis adds a pause that suggests the opposite of what is stated.

20. Overuse of Positive Adjectives:
    Overusing positive adjectives in a context where they don't fit can indicate sarcasm.
    - Example: "This 'delicious' cafeteria food is just what I needed."
      The adjective "delicious" in quotation marks suggests the opposite.

21. Incongruous Hashtags:
    Using hashtags that don't match the context of the post can signal sarcasm.
    - Example: "Got soaked in the rain. #LivingTheDream"
      The hashtag "#LivingTheDream" contrasts with the unpleasant experience.

22. Self-Deprecating Remarks:
    Sarcastic comments that make fun of the poster themselves can be common on social media.
    - Example: "Guess who forgot their keys again? #genius"
      The hashtag "#genius" indicates sarcasm about forgetting keys.

23. Mimicking Popular Phrases:
    Mimicking popular phrases or memes in a way that subverts their original meaning can indicate sarcasm.
    - Example: "Because who doesn't love working on weekends?"
      The phrase subverts the positive connotation of loving something.
